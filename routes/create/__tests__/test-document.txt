The Pragmatic Programmer emphasizes several key design principles for building evolvable systems:

1. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): This principle states that every piece of knowledge must have a single, 
unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system. By avoiding duplication, changes need to be 
made in only one place, making the system more maintainable and evolvable.

2. Orthogonality: Design components to be independent and self-contained. When components are orthogonal, 
changes to one don't affect others, allowing the system to evolve more easily. This reduces risk and 
makes testing simpler.

3. Reversibility: Don't assume any decision is final. Design systems to be flexible enough to accommodate 
change. Use abstractions and interfaces to insulate different parts of the system from each other.

4. Tracer Bullets: Build a minimal end-to-end implementation first, then evolve it. This approach helps 
you understand the system's architecture early and allows for rapid feedback and adjustment.

5. Prototypes and Post-it Notes: Use cheap, disposable prototypes to explore ideas before committing to 
a full implementation. This allows for experimentation without the cost of building production code.
